    <h2>About Vegetable Soup</h2>
    <p>This is Nigerian cuisine also known as Edikang Ikong. This is a nutritious, tasty, leafy green vegetable soup
        from Southern Nigeria. It is made with fluted pumpkin leaves and waterleaf. The original version of this soup is
        made with water leaves and fluted pumpkin leaves (Ugu).</p>
    <p>This should not be mistaken for Afang soup.I can't really tell the difference by look just by taste. I'm gonna
        share
        how i make mine. </p>
